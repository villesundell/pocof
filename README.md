# PoCoF - Portable Context Format for Neural Networks

Neural networks, in their various forms, are likely to remain integral to our work, with their influence growing year by year. However, a significant challenge persists: the lack of an efficient method to share and preserve our work—a fundamental human need, as this document itself indirectly illustrates.

Currently, sharing and collaborating on AI workflows often involve exporting work as formats like PDF, JPG, or raw text, which strips away all the crucial context in the process. This loss of context hinders effective collaboration and the preservation of valuable insights, making it difficult to build upon existing work seamlessly.

Despite the diverse nature of large language models and neural networks, one possible solution is outlined here. By defining context through key parameters, such as the weighted ordering of tokens and other critical states, PoCoF provides a way to create a portable context that can be transferred between models while maintaining accuracy and relevance over time.

PoCoF leverages XML, a technology that offers extensibility, interoperability, and compatibility with version control systems like Git. XML’s structured format is ideal for long-term preservation, ensuring that the context remains accessible, useful, and easily adaptable to evolving AI workflows well into the future.
